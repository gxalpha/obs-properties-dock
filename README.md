# Properties Dock for OBS Studio!

**Note: This plugin is not yet stable and should be used for testing purposes only.**

This is a plugin for OBS Studio which adds the Source Properties and Edit Transform windows as docks. This way, you can more easily see the effects of your changes live as it happens, making editing much more convinient.

Note: CI Builds will be added once the build scripts have been fixed upstream. See [the PR](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate#19) there.
